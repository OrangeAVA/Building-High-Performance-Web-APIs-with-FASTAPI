## Building High-Performance Web APIs with FastAPI

This is the repository for [Building High-Performance Web APIs with FastAPI](https://orangeava.com/products/building-high-performance-web-apis-with-fastapi), published by Orange AVA™

## About the Book
APIs are the backbone of today’s interconnected digital world, powering everything from mobile apps to enterprise systems. Building them to be fast, scalable, and secure is critical for modern software success. Building High-Performance Web APIs with FastAPI shows you how to achieve exactly that—using Python’s cutting-edge FastAPI framework.

Starting with RESTful API fundamentals and FastAPI’s core principles, you will set up your development environment, install the framework, and explore its key features. You will  progress through designing and validating data models with Pydantic, implementing authentication and authorization, handling file uploads, and integrating relational databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.

From there, you will master testing and debugging techniques, learn deployment strategies with Docker and Kubernetes, and scale your APIs with best practices for performance and security. Real-world projects and step-by-step examples make each concept easy to grasp and apply.

Thus, by the end, you will have the skills and confidence to design, build, and deploy production-ready APIs that meet today’s performance and reliability standards.

Hence, whether you are a developer, architect, or engineer, Building High-Performance Web APIs with FastAPI is your roadmap to mastering high-performance API development—start building the APIs your users deserve.
